Grocery inventory app for iOS, currently in development.

INTRODUCTION
------------

This app takes a different approach to managing grocery shopping plans than the traditional shopping list, by maintaining an inventory of items that household users want to keep on hand and whether those items are in or out of stock. Inventories will be shared amongst household members on their different devices, so anyone can quickly mark an item as low or out of stock when they notice it running out. Users can instantly generate grocery lists based on what items are in stock and where they prefer to buy those items, allowing them to make smart shopping decisions even if they didn't have time to plan ahead.
